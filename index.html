                <h1>Book Swap!<img src="images/cover_book.jpg"></h1>
                <p>Book Swap is the perfect resource for students tired of wasting their valuable money on expensive books. With so many classes and pricy books, spending a fortune on books can make you start to wonder if your education is even worth it. <em>Book Swap</em> solves this problem, by providing a easy way for college students to share books.</p>
                <p><em>Book Swap</em> Members only ever need to buy books once! After you've bought a semester's worth of books and the semester is over, simply turn in your books for "book points". Once you rack up some book points, simply search your school location for someone selling the book you need, and send them your book points after you get the book from them.</p>
